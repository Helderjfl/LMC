<h2>Wellingborough School - Little Man Computer Simulator</h2>
<p>This site contains an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer">Little Man Computer</a>
The simulator is implemented using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and runs entirely client-side.
It is fully functional, and includes several example programs.</p>

<p><a href="https://wellingborough.github.io/LMC/LMC0.3.html" class="button">Get Started!</a></p>

<p>My intention was to create a simple-to-use web application which would help students to program in the LMC language.<br />
The app features a clickable CPU diagram which is animated when an LMC program executes, showing the values in the main registers, data flows within the CPU, and memory read and write activity.<br />
Programs can be saved to local disk storage, uploaded from local storage, and converted to PDF for printing (or including in project reports).
The Little Man Computer simulator app can be found <a href="https://wellingborough.github.io/LMC/LMC0.3.html">here</a>
If you have any questions or comments on this LMC simulator, please contact me at mga@wellingboroughschool.org</p>
