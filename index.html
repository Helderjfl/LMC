      <h2>Wellingborough School - Little Man Computer Simulator</h2>
      <p>This site contains an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer">Little Man Computer</a></p>
      <p>The simulator is implemented using JavaScript, HTML and CSS and runs entirely client-side.</p>
      <p>It is fully functional, and includes several example programs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wellingborough.github.io/LMC/LMC0.3.html" style="background-color: #4CAF50; border: none; color: white; padding: 15px 32px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px;">Get Started!</a></p>
      <p>My intention was to create a simple-to-use web application which would help students to program in the LMC language.<br />
      <p>The app features a clickable CPU diagram which is animated when an LMC program executes, showing the values in the main registers, data flows within the CPU, and memory read and write activity.</p>

      <p>The code editor is based on a table design, making it easy to separate labels, operators, and operands</p>
      <p><img src="images/CodeEditor.png" alt="Picture of the LMC Code Editor, with a sample program loaded" style="border: 2px solid #555;"><p>
      <p>Programs can be saved to local disk storage, uploaded from local storage, and converted to PDF for printing (or including in project reports).</p>
      <p>When an LMC program is running, the console provides a summary of each operation.</p>

      <p>The Little Man Computer simulator app can be found <a href="https://wellingborough.github.io/LMC/LMC0.3.html">here</a></p>
